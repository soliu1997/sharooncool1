	<u>Front-end developer</u>
	<p>A front end web developer is the person who implements web designs through coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though it’s not as common anymore, front end developers are/were sometimes called “client-side developers” to distinguish them from back end developers who program what goes on behind the scenes (like databases). If you head to any site, you can see the work of a front end developer everywhere—in the navigation, layouts including this article page, even the way that a site looks different from your phone (thanks to mobile-first or responsive design).

	<dd><u><strong>What Skills do Front End Web Developers Use?</strong></u><br></dd>
<dt>Front end web developers use three primary coding languages to code the website and web app designs created by web designers:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
The code they write runs inside the user’s browser (as opposed to a back end developer, whose code runs on the web server). Think of it a little like this: the back end developer is like the engineer who designs and creates the systems that make a city work (electricity, water and sewer, zoning, etc.), while the front end developer is the one who lays out the streets and makes sure everything is connected properly so people can live their lives (a simplified analogy, but you get the rough idea). A front end web developer is also in charge of making sure that there are no errors or bugs on the front end, as well as making sure that the design appears as it’s supposed to across various platforms and browsers.
I’ve combed through dozens of front end web developer job listings to see which skills are the most in-demand right now. These are the things that real employers are looking for in job applicants today (and will still be looking for in the near future). Master these things and you’re certain to land an awesome front end dev job!</dt>

<dd><u><strong> What skills do back-end developers use?</strong></u></dd>
<dt>Back-end developers work hand-in-hand with front-end developers by providing the outward facing web application elements server-side logic. In other words, back-end developers create the logic to make the web app function properly, and they accomplish this through the use of server-side scripting languages like Ruby or PHP.
Aside from making web applications functional, back-end developers are also responsible for optimizing the application for speed and efficiency. Moreover, back-end developers often create a data storage solution with a database, which is a crucial component for all web applications since it stores information (like users, comments, posts, etc.). Common databases include MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.</dt>
